I've always loved the tactile experience of interacting with physical objects. The sensation of pressing a button, turning a dial, or sliding a switch adds a layer of engagement and control that's often missing in digital interfaces. This fascination with tangible interactions led me to explore the concept of Knubl—a physical multimedia controller designed to bridge the gap between digital content and physical interaction.

## The Inspiration

Most high-end mechanical keyboards have a rotary encoder or knob as a volume control. I found this feature to be incredibly convenient and satisfying to use, prompting me to consider how similar controls could enhance other digital experiences.

The idea of a physical controller that could manipulate multimedia content—such as music, videos, and images—using intuitive gestures and tactile feedback intrigued me. I envisioned a device that would allow users to adjust volume, skip tracks, zoom in on images, and perform other actions through simple, natural movements.

## The Goal

The primary objective of the Knubl project was to create a versatile multimedia controller that could seamlessly integrate with various devices and platforms. I aimed to design a device that would enhance user interaction with digital content, providing a more engaging and intuitive experience than traditional input methods. By combining physical controls with smart sensors and wireless connectivity, Knubl sought to offer a novel approach to multimedia manipulation that catered to users' preferences and habits.

## Where I'm at now

As of right now, I am working on making a prototype with an NRF52840 microcontroller and a rotary encoder. I am also working on the firmware for the device, which will handle the sensor inputs and communicate with the connected devices. The next steps involve refining the hardware design, implementing additional features, and conducting user testing to gather feedback and improve the user experience.

The goal is to make this project as versatile as possible, whether it's stationed at a desk or used as a handheld device. I'm excited to see how Knubl evolves and how it can enhance the way users interact with their digital content.
